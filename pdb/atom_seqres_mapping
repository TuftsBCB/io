Mapping SEQRES residues to ATOM records
=======================================

The idea is to use the info in REMARK 465. We make the following assumption:
Every residue in SEQRES that is NOT present as an ATOM record has a 
corresponding entry in REMARK 465.

This assumption seems consistent with the PDB format documentation:

    REMARK 465 lists the residues that are present in the SEQRES records but 
    are completely absent from the coordinates section.

Using this assumption, we can construct a precise alignment of ATOM records 
with their corresponding SEQRES residues. i.e., start with two lists: 465's and 
ATOMs and generate a new list. The first element of the list is the smaller of 
the smallest elements from the 465's and ATOMs (where ordinality is defined by 
their residue sequence number). The next element is the next smallest, etc.

Invariants of this list (for a particular chain):

    The length is equivalent to the number of residues in the SEQRES records
    for a particular chain.

    The residue sequence numbers are contiugous (increment by one for each
    element in the resulting list).

    Every element in the list belongs to either (exclusive) the 465 list 
    (missing ATOM record) or the ATOM record list (has an ATOM record).

    The list has a correspondence with the list of residues generated from 
    SEQRES records.

Once this list is computed, it is a precise correspondence to residues in the 
SEQRES records. Thus, a residue in the list formed from an ATOM record 
contains the coordinate information for the corresponding residue in the SEQRES 
record.

Example: See PDB entry 3MXQ. It is a particularly extreme example with negative 
sequence numbers, and gaps in the ATOM records on both ends of the query 
sequence *and* in the middle. (On several chains.) Note here that the negative 
sequence numbers are OK; so long as they are consistent among themselves (i.e., 
contiguous and increasing).
