/*
Package newick provides facilities for reading and writing trees in the
Newick format. The format used is roughly equivalent to the conventions
established here:
http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newick_doc.html. Although,
comments and quoted labels are not (yet) implemented.

An informal description of the Newick format can be found here:
http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html.

Currently, this package only includes a reader, but a writer will be added as
needed.
